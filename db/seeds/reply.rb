We come in through Toranira with a perfectly legitimate flight plan filed, headed to Illyrica through Zoave Twilight. And that is exactly where we go, but while we're in Vega space, we drop off three of our ships - not troops or armaments, but the ships themselves. Then at Illyrica we pick up three new ones. Winterfair gifts from Emperor Gregor.\"<br><br>Through the ship's internal system rather than his pen, he sends the specs to Baz's comconsole.<br><br>\"The only trouble is, my brother just walked off with a third of our trade inventory. We were supposed to give away the <i>Triumph</i>, the <i>D-16</i>, and the <i>Ariel</i>. The nearest possible substitute for the missing ship is Truzillo's <i>Jayhawk</i>. I'm <em>really</em> hoping I can reel Thorne back in before we have to leave, because while the replacement ship would be an across-the-board improvement on the <i>Ariel</i>, it falls a little short of the <i>Jayhawk</i>'s firepower.

We wait here for as long as it takes to get the ship ready to go. If we hear back from Bel in the meantime, well and good, we meet it en route and escort the <i>Ariel</i> back to the fleet. If not - the departure schedule for this mission is flexible on the scale of days, but not weeks. I give it until forty-eight hours from this moment.
