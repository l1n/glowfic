# frozen_string_literal: true

# Returns a 503 to non-logged-in users whose request has already been waiting
# in Puma's queue longer than `WAIT_THRESHOLD_SECONDS` by the time it gets a
# worker. Frees the worker to serve a logged-in request from the queue
# instead.
#
# This is a load-shedding layer that complements the steady-state rate limits
# in `config/initializers/rack_attack.rb`. Under normal load the queue wait
# is sub-100ms and this middleware passes everything through unchanged; it
# only triggers when the system is genuinely saturated (large queues, slow
# requests, dyno restart re-saturation). When that happens, anonymous
# traffic gets a fast 503 + Retry-After instead of being held in queue and
# eventually rack-timeout-aborted; logged-in traffic continues normally.
#
# `WAIT_THRESHOLD_SECONDS` was 5s until 2026-10. At 5s the queue never had to
# drain for anyone: in the week to 2026-10-04, logged-in pages took 0.1-0.25s
# to serve at the median but waited 0.7-1.6s in the queue first, and over 5s
# at p95, behind anonymous traffic that was never shed until it had already
# waited 5s. Shedding anonymous readers at 1s keeps the queue short enough
# that logged-in users are not stuck in it. Logged-in users are never shed.
#
# `ANON_SHED_WAIT_SECONDS` sets it without a deploy (a config change restarts
# the dynos), e.g. back to 5 if logged-out readers are shed too often. It is
# kept between the scraper threshold below and rack-timeout's wait timeout.

  # In the seven days to 2026-09-09 the scrape was 9.7M of the 12.5M HTML
  # navigations and 469 of the 594 dyno-hours spent serving them, while 65,595
  # genuine page loads (2.4%) were shed as collateral. Both classes were
  # competing on the same 5s threshold, so the shedder was splitting the
  # damage between them instead of aiming it.
  #
  # This is still a threshold and not a block: below it, scraper-shaped
  # traffic is served exactly as before. It only bites once the queue is deep
  # enough that somebody is going to be shed regardless, and it decides who.

  # most common answer — in steady state nothing is saturated, so this costs
  # one env lookup and returns. The shape check comes next at a handful of
  # header string comparisons, and only runs on requests already waiting long
  # enough to be worth classifying. Identifying the user comes last because it means
  # building a cookie jar to verify a signature, which is only worth doing on
