Yenaro chooses this occasion to tell the lady that Ivan was born in the usual - well, the normal, anyway - fashion.

The accent's the trickiest part by far; he's had time to practice it, but not to get it bone-deep and quick as breathing like the Barrayaran one.<br><br>The image of a face materializes above the vid plate, interposing itself between him and the mirror. Her grey-and-white uniform is better kept than his, properly adorned with a lieutenant's insignia and a name patch. \"Comm Officer Hereld, <i>Triumph</i>, Dendarii Free... Corporation,\" she says, not quite stumbling over the substitution; in peaceful Escobaran space, a mercenary fleet must pass with weapons sealed and good intentions verified and even its name slightly censored.<br><br>Mark—<em>Miles</em>—flashes her the Naismith grin. \"Good to see you, Lieutenant,\" he says. Betan pronunciation, the fluid <i>-eu-</i> instead of the sibilant <i>-eff-</i> of a Barrayaran or Londoner.<br><br>She lights up instantly. \"Admiral Naismith, sir! You're back!\" Her smile is like a hit of some intensely addictive drug, juba or dreamline, something that takes you higher than an orbital flight and then burns you up on reentry. It feels good now, oh yes, but the comedown is going to be hell... can't think about that now. Miles wouldn't. \"What's up? Are we going to be moving out soon?\"<br><br>\"In good time, Lieutenant,\" he says, smiling a wait-for-it smile. \"You'll see. And in the meanwhile, I want a pick-up from this station.\"<br><br>\"Yes, sir,\" nods Hereld. \"I can get that for you. Is Captain Quinn with you?\"<br><br>If he were really Miles, she would be, almost certainly; but Hereld doesn't know that. Mark shakes his head. \"Not at the moment.\"<br><br>\"Oh? When will she be following?\"<br><br>\"Later,\" he says smoothly.<br><br>\"Right, sir. Let me just get clearance for—are we loading any equipment?\"<br><br>He shakes his head again. \"Just me.\"<br><br>\"For a personnel pod, then.\" She shifts her eyes from the vid pickup for a few seconds, then reports, \"I can have someone at docking bay E17 in about twenty minutes.\"<br><br>Which is just about the time it would take him to reach docking bay E17 from this comm booth at a dead run. \"Perfect.

Lieutenant Herald's face dissolves into twinkling lights. <em>Admiral Naismith</em> takes a deep breath. He's in it now, all right. The energy of Miles's soul fills him to overflowing, issuing from that bottomless well in the back of his mind.
